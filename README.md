# Single_Cell_Astrocyte_Project
The goal of this project is to see whether the expression of AQP4, a key water channel in the brain is differentially expressed between AD and control brain
tissue samples. AQP4 is a protein implicated in CSF-ISF exchange within the brain's glymphatic system, and a decrease in glymphatic function likely occurs in AD.
I hypothesized that I will see a decrease in AQP4 expression under AD conditions, however I did not see this result from my study. I believe this is due to 
flawed methodology in how I calculated and compared the gene expression of the Astrocyte cells. I also believe it is due to insufficent sample size to detect
an effect.
